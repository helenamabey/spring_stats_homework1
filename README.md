Homework 1 
Please submit your homework (pdf or doc file, including the codes and outputs) to Canvas. 
Part One: Python programming 
Question 1 Python basics 
Create a vector that contains numbers 1 through 1000 that only contains the even numbers.  Label this vector “even.”  Verify the length and that it contains even numbers. 
Create another vector that contains all the odd numbers.  Verify the length and that it contains odd numbers. 
Create two vectors of length 500.  The first vector is a repetition of “TRUE” and “FALSE” and the other vector is a repetition of “Red” and “Blue.”  Verify lengths and data of each vector. 
Create a data frame of all the vectors create thus far in this exercise.  Verify lengths and data. 
Return the 100th, 200th, …, 500th elements of the even vector. 
Return the 101st, 201st, 301st, 401st, and 499th elements of the odd vector. 
Return the elements of the even vector that are less than 23 or greater than or equal to 451. 
Return the elements of the odd vectors that are greater than 52 and less than or equal to 300. 
Change the “True” and “False” vector into a vector of factors. 
Change the “Red” and “Blue” vector into a vector of factors. 
Create another vector that adds the entries of the even and odd vectors (add values of each element of two vectors).  Verify data. 
Obtain all the elements the vector created in (11) except elements 200th through 400th. 
Write a function to find the mean, variance, standard deviation and statistics summary for the even and odd vectors created.  
Question 2 File read exercise 
Download the ForestFires2 data set  
Find your current working directory in python.  Change it if you need to. 
Read in the ForestFires data set into python.  Validate the column names and dimensions to make sure the data is all there. 
For temp, wind, rain, and area in the ForestFires data set, find the statistics summary including length, sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, range, log of each data.   
Change/Verify if the variables Month and Day into/are categorical variables. 
Create a histogram of the area burned.  Is it normal? 
Create scatterplots for all numeric values in the dataset. Any strong correlations are found? 
What is the maximum and minimum temperature that a forest fire occurred?  Convert this into Fahrenheit. 
Question 3 Missing values 
 
1) 
create the following data set in python.  Then write the code to count the number of occurrences of missing values in the data. And calculate the mean of “Malformation Present” without the missing values.

Question 6 
 For this problem, use the data in Retirement Funds. 
a. Construct a table that tabulates market cap, risk, and rating. 
b. What conclusions can you reach concerning differences among the categories of funds (large cap, medium cap, and small cap), risk objective (low, average and high) and ratings (one, two, three, four five)? 
Create bar chat and pie chart for “market cap”, “risk” and “rating” 
Construct a histogram and a boxplot for “Assets” 
Construct a scatter plot for all numerical variables: such as “Assets”, “Turnover Ratio”, Beta, etc. 
f. Based on (c) through (e), what conclusions can you reach. 
 
Question 7 
 The file CE0-Compensation includes the total compensation (in millions of $) of CEOs of 197 large public companies and the investment return in 2012. 
Source: Data extracted from D. Leonard, “Bargains in the Boardroom,” The NewYork Times. 
a. Construct a frequency distribution and a percentage distribution. 
b. Construct a histogram and a percentage polygon. 
c. Construct a cumulative percentage distribution and plot a cumulative percentage polygon (ogive). 
d. Based on (a) through (c), what conclusions can you reach concerning CEO compensation in 2012? 
e. Construct a scatter plot of total compensation and investment return in 2012. 
f. What is the relationship between the total compensation and investment return in 2012?
